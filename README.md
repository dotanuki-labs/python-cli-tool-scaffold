# Scaffold for CLI Tools with Python

## Why

I found this setup very nice, so I'd like to have it available in the easiest way possible for my new Python projects (mostly CLI tools).

## Features

- Project driven by [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- Supports Python `3.10.x` and `3.11.x` at local development level and CI level
- Code conventions driven by [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- Code formatting driven by [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- Improved error traces driven by [Pretty Errors](https://github.com/onelivesleft/PrettyErrors/)
- Dead code detection driven by [Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture)
- Security checks driven by [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Compreehensive Makefile wrapping common target tasks
- **Github Actions** Workflow to validate checks on Pull Requests
- **Github Actions** Workflow to deploy artifacts on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/) on Github releases
- Opinionated CHANGELOG file driven by [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com)
- Ready to automatically track code coverage with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)
- [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) ready (`poetry`, `pyenv` and and Github Actions)
- [Mergify](https://mergify.io/) ready (automated merges for Dependabot updates)
- [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit) licensed

## How to use

- Get this template

- Run the companion script

```bash
$> ./scaffold <your project name>
```

- Ensure your Github repository has the native [Dependabot integration enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates)

- Link your Github repository with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)

- Add you Pypi access token - as `PYPI_TOKEN` - in Github Actions [Secrets Manager](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)

- Set your name and email at `pyproject.toml` (as **author**)
- Set link(s) for your project repository at `pyproject.toml` (**homepage** and **repository**)
- If needed, update/change Python version at `pyproject.toml` and for both YAML files at `.github/workflows`
- If your project is open-source, update the `LICENSE` file

- Profit! ðŸ’¯
